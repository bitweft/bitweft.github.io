        <p>It has been long since the time you took birth<br>
          And there is no word or thing that can explain your worth</p>

        <p>In all these years, tough or smooth times you have seen<br>
          You overcame all obstacles and strong you have always been</p>

        <p>To your parents, you were a wonderful daughter<br>
          Your love for them was deeper than the ocean’s water</p>

        <p>An awesome sister you are<br>
          Your siblings obviously consider you a star</p>

        <p>Then you became the most wonderful wife<br>
          And Pa cannot imagine without you; a life</p>

        <p>Soon later, you became a mother<br>
          That’s the relation that can’t be replaced by any other </p>

        <p>You brought me to this world, which is known to be big and bad<br>
          But you protected me in your shelter of love and always kept me glad</p>

        <p>You taught me to talk<br>
          You held my hand and made me walk</p>

        <p>You sang for me bhajans and nursery rhymes<br>
          To me, your voice was sweeter than the wind chimes</p>

        <p>Karate, you wanted me to learn<br>
          When I didn’t want to go, you became strict and stern</p>

        <p>You let me enjoy; you let me play<br>
          You allowed me to take decisions and many times let me do things my way</p>

        <p>But you always guided me and gave me support<br>
          You motivated me to do a lot of things including studying, driving and sport</p>

        <p>You gave me love, you gave me your smile<br>
          You also taught me a lot of style</p>

        <p>You told me about good values and taught me to pray<br>
          You explained to me to keep bad things at bay</p>

        <p>My frustration, shouting and tantrums you boar<br>
          You sat and spoke to me calmly even after tiring work and everyday chore</p>

        <p>A million things you have done for me<br>
          By appreciating you with words or even my deeds; justice it wont be</p>

        <p>All I want to say right now is Thank you for being with me through thick and thin<br>
          And I know you will be by my side even in the future as you have in the past always been</p>

        <p>Thank you Ma for shaping me and making me who I am.</p>
