        <p>We may call this day our ‘farewell’ day<br>
          But it’s definitely not an end, I say<br>
          It’s just the beginning of the new roads that we take<br>
          So that, ‘wonderful’, our lives we make</p>

        <p>So many times we have been together<br>
          At the bus stop, lectures or to buy wallets made of leather<br>
          Picnics are obviously things that we will remember<br>
          And ya, you are like my family member.</p>

        <p>We have had great times<br>
          Have sung together nursery rhymes<br>
          Worked together day and night<br>
          And fought in the break for a tasty byte</p>

        <p>College without you, would have been worse than hell<br>
          You made it better, that’s all I can tell.<br>
          You were there to bring, with your PJ’s, a lot of cheer<br>
          And of course, in joy making us shed a tear.</p>

        <p>No matter, we will be how far or near<br>
          You will be a friend very dear<br>
          Who ignored and forgot all the fights<br>
          And who strived hard to set things right</p>

        <p>Memorable were these 4 years<br>
          And I apologise if I hurt you by holding my ears<br>
          All fun times are inscribed in my heart deep<br>
          And I know, this, even you will in your heart always keep</p>

        <p>All I can say now is each moment spent with you was a great treasure<br>
          Beyond any measure!<br>
          May you have success always, I pray<br>
          And may always on the top you stay. </p>

        <p>And thanks to you my dearest friend for those wonderful times and memories!</p>
