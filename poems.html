It has been long since the time you took birth
And there is no word or thing that can explain your worth

In all these years, tough or smooth times you have seen
You overcame all obstacles and strong you have always been

To your parents, you were a wonderful daughter
Your love for them was deeper than the ocean's water

An awesome sister you are
Your siblings obviously consider you a star

Then you became the most wonderful wife
And Pa cannot imagine without you; a life

Soon later, you became a mother
That's the relation that can't be replaced by any other

You brought me to this world, which is known to be big and bad
But you protected me in your shelter of love and always kept me glad

You taught me to talk
You held my hand and made me walk

You sang for me bhajans and nursery rhymes
To me, your voice was sweeter than the wind chimes

Karate, you wanted me to learn
When I didn't want to go, you became strict and stern

You let me enjoy; you let me play
You allowed me to take decisions and many times let me do things my way

But you always guided me and gave me support
You motivated me to do a lot of things including studying, driving and sport

You gave me love, you gave me your smile
You also taught me a lot of style

You told me about good values and taught me to pray
You explained to me to keep bad things at bay

My frustration, shouting and tantrums you boar
You sat and spoke to me calmly even after tiring work and everyday chore

A million things you have done for me
By appreciating you with words or even my deeds; justice it wont be

All I want to say right now is Thank you for being with me through thick and thin
And I know you will be by my side even in the future as you have in the past always been

Thank you Ma for shaping me and making me who I am.

I wandered into a lane that I thought would take me home,
Shocked I was to see a wild tiger there left alone.

I turned and tried to run
But that animal wanted to have fun!

It was hungry and wanted my meat
I was frightened to think that it would have a wonderful treat.

I called out to spider man for help
He came but the tiger got better of him and I could hear only yelp.

Then I called for super-man
He didn't do much, so he lost his good 'fan'. (that was me)

Then Batman came dressed in black
The tiger fought him and sent him back.

I wanted to wail
Would anybody win over the tiger and not refuse to fail?

Then to save me, came my Dad
He felt he could finish the animal that was bad.

He fought it with all his might
But I was afraid that the tiger would bite.

But dad knew that he wouldn't fall
Coz his love for me would always stand tall.

He was right and the tiger was killed,
And with tremendous amount of joy, I was filled.

But, before I could hug him, buzzed my phone
I realized that it was my alarm tone.

Oh! I sighed. It was only a dream
Heck, my dad is still the King.

No matter who the world thinks is the best,
I know for sure that my Dad is above the rest!

Thank You Pa for being my SUPER HERO!!

This that I speak of is experience true
Incidents like this are definitely few.

It may be funny and to some memorable
But for me it was just a day terrible.

I was up at seven on that fateful Thursday
Because, fell on my face those golden sun rays.

College I was, rearing to go
For my football match, against the EXTC foes

I got out of bed and imagined myself on the field
Dreamt about the good results that our teams practice would yield

Kicking the ball towards me, I saw my midfielder team-mate
All I had to do was to head the ball into the goal straight.

I actually ran ahead and leapt high to head the ball
But banged myself against the bedroom wall

Came back to reality coz of the hard impact
And realized that my front tooth was no longer intact

I didn't want to smile, I didn't want to laugh
I didn't want anyone to see my tooth that was half

Didn't want to go to college that day
But then there was a match that I had to play.

Popped a pain-killer and to college I went
And told all my friends the morning's incident

They laughed, and photographs of the chipped tooth they wanted to click
And even I was amused thinking I was such a foolish football freak

With you I share my secrets deep
And I know for sure in your heart you will keep
You will, by my side always be
And during bad times, not flee.

You are brilliant and you are smart
Yet, you are humble and have a good heart
You have always been a friend true
And, kind people like you, there are very few

You are tall and you are thin
You have beautiful eyes and a fair skin
Your nose is sharp and you lips are pink
All day, only about you I think

I know that it is not the appearance that matters
It is more about our friendship that never shatters
You are my true friend
With you, all my life I would like to spend

My dear friend, I really love you
Yes you are the best and very few find people like you.
