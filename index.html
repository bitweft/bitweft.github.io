<p>I wandered into a lane that I thought would take me home, <br>
Shocked I was to see a wild tiger there left alone. </p>

<p>I turned and tried to run <br>
But that animal wanted to have fun! </p>

<p>It was hungry and wanted my meat<br>
 I was frightened to think that it would have a wonderful treat. </p>

<p>I called out to spider man for help <br>
He came but the tiger got better of him and I could hear only yelp. </p>

<p>Then I called for super-man <br>
He didn’t do much, so he lost his good ‘fan’. (that was me) </p>

<p>Then Batman came dressed in black <br>
The tiger fought him and sent him back. </p>

<p>I wanted to wail <br>
Would anybody win over the tiger and not refuse to fail? </p>

<p>Then to save me, came my dad <br>
He felt he could finish the animal that was bad. </p>

<p>He fought it with all his might <br>
But I was afraid that the tiger would bite. </p>

<p>But dad knew that he wouldn’t fall<br>
 Coz his love for me would always stand tall. </p>

<p>He was right and the tiger was killed,<br>
 And with tremendous amount of joy, I was filled. </p>

<p>But, before I could hug him, buzzed my phone <br>
I realized that it was my alarm tone. </p>

<p>Oh! I sighed. It was only a dream<br>
 Heck, my dad is still the king. </p>

<p>No matter who the world thinks is the best,<br>
 I know for sure that my dad is above the rest! </p>

<p>Thank You Pa for being my SUPER HERO!!</p>
