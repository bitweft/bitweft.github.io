        <p>I wandered into a lane that I thought would take me home,<br>
          Shocked I was to see a wild tiger there left alone.</p>

        <p>I turned and tried to run<br>
          But that animal wanted to have fun!</p>

        <p>It was hungry and wanted my meat<br>
          I was frightened to think that it would have a wonderful treat.</p>

        <p>I called out to spider man for help<br>
          He came but the tiger got better of him and I could hear only yelp.</p>

        <p>Then I called for super-man<br>
          He didn’t do much, so he lost his good ‘fan’.</p>

        <p>Then Batman came dressed in black<br>
          The tiger fought him and sent him back.</p>

        <p>I wanted to wail<br>
          Would anybody win over the tiger and not refuse to fail?</p>

        <p>Then to save me, came my dad<br>
          He felt he could finish the animal that was bad.</p>

        <p>He fought it with all his might<br>
          But I was afraid that the tiger would bite.</p>

        <p>But dad knew that he wouldn’t fall<br>
          Coz his love for me would always stand tall.</p>

        <p>He was right and the tiger was killed,<br>
          And with tremendous amount of joy, I was filled.</p>

        <p>But, before I could hug him, buzzed my phone<br>
          I realized that it was my alarm tone.</p>

        <p>Oh! I sighed. It was only a dream<br>
          Heck, my dad is still the king.</p>

        <p>No matter who the world thinks is the best,<br>
          I know for sure that my dad is above the rest!</p>

        <p>Thank You Pa for being my SUPER HERO!!</p>
