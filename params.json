(that was me) \r\n\r\nThen Batman came dressed in black    \r\nThe tiger fought him and sent him back. \r\n\r\nI wanted to wail    \r\nWould anybody win over the tiger and not refuse to fail? \r\n\r\nThen to save me, came my dad    \r\nHe felt he could finish the animal that was bad. \r\n\r\nHe fought it with all his might    \r\nBut I was afraid that the tiger would bite. \r\n\r\nBut dad knew that he wouldn’t fall   \r\n Coz his love for me would always stand tall. \r\n\r\nHe was right and the tiger was killed,   \r\n And with tremendous amount of joy, I was filled. \r\n\r\nBut, before I could hug him, buzzed my phone    \r\nI realized that it was my alarm tone. \r\n\r\nOh! I sighed. It was only a dream   \r\n Heck, my dad is still the king. \r\n\r\nNo matter who the world thinks is the best,   \r\n I know for sure that my dad is above the rest! \r\n\r\nThank You Pa for being my SUPER HERO!!","google":"UA-41776016-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
