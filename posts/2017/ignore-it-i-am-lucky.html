                <p>
                </p>

                <p>As she stops her auto-geared black coloured two wheeler in the Parking of Shambu Parathas and Biryani
                    - a popular restaurant near her apartment, Revathi looks at her watch. It says 10:15pm - almost closing
                    time.
                </p>

                <p>She rushes past the relatively empty parking into the restaurant and takes the first empty table.
                    With a deep breath in and an even longer exhale, she hopes her tiredness from the long day at work
                    would vanish.
                </p>

                <p>A customary action of the waiter leaves her surprised when he places two glasses of water instead of
                    just one on her table. ‘Oh habits!’, she thinks as she calls out to the waiter to take the extra
                    glass back. His confused expression makes her speculate that it was not a habit but an assumption
                    that women don’t come to restaurants alone; at least not at that hour.
                    “Give him benefit of doubt”, she tells herself as she relates this to a few incidents during the
                    day.
                </p>

                <p>Rahul, Vijay and Revathi had attended a meeting with potential clients that day. During introduction,
                    Sanjeev, from the client party shook hands with both Rahul and Vijay but skipped Revathi even though
                    she was standing in between them. "Could it be because he was shy? But this is a professional
                    environment. Could it be because she wasn’t a man? Could it be religious?” With so many thoughts
                    racing through her mind, she had stepped forward and extended her hand towards Sanjeev with an
                    introduction. He had reciprocated the action. “Maybe it was just male ego that had stopped him from doing an
                    introduction first”, she had thought to herself. “But well, I don’t know for sure, so I should not
                    judge.”
                </p>

                <p>Her chain of thoughts get interrupted when the waiter serves her her meal. She thanks him. Biting
                    into her food, she thinks about her presentation to the clients earlier that day.</p>

                <p>She had taken great efforts to prepare the slides and had even practiced delivery once. She was sure
                    that the presentation itself had been impressive but what happened after had left her a little
                    frustrated. All questions were directed to her male colleagues. Even when she had answered those
                    questions, many men had turned to Rahul and Vijay to ensure that they nodded in acceptance. “But
                    then, no one else in the room had noticed or had felt that way. Maybe I’m overthinking”, she tells
                    herself as she finishes dinner.</p>

                <p>She glances at her watch again. “Yes, it’s late.”</p>

                <p>At about 7:30pm, when the client team decided to hold one more discussion, Mark had asked Revathi if
                    she needed to get home early to her family and cook or if she could wait a little longer till the
                    end of the discussion. “Assumptions! Assumptions that I have a family here and I’ve to cook for
                    them!”, she had thought to herself. “I can stay longer”, was all that she had told Mark.<br>
                    “Maybe I should have told him that some 32 year olds might not be married and might have chosen to
                    stay alone. But I am sure he meant well”, she assures herself.
                </p>

                <p>As she walks back to the parking after making her payment, Revathi thinks, “I have no clue why I am
                    wasting my energy over these petty incidents. I’m an independent working woman mostly surrounded by
                    decent educated men. I’m sure I hardly experience problems that many women living in other
                    conditions do. There’s no real reason to fret or even waste a moment thinking about these petty
                    things”.</p>

                <p>Revathi, like many other women, convinces herself that these are insignificant incidents that need no
                    mention or address. “I wouldn’t want those men to perceive me as an overly sensitive person who
                    makes a mountain of a molehill”. She silences her potential to bring about a positive change with
                    the thought, “In comparison to many other women, I am very lucky!”</p>
